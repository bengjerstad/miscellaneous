# miscellaneous
I plan to use this for random scripts and smaller projects. 

## pinger.bat
Used to ping multiple computers and play a sound when one responds.

## folderwatcher.py 
prints out changes to a folder. Polls every sec. Used for watching/logging of a shared folder. 
## MPA.py
MPA is short for my personal assistant. This is just a mini framework for launching commands from the command line. But, right now it does not do anything. 
Use: 
>>ping [computername or IP]
* runs the ping command for the IP address

>>on [computername or IP]
>>ping
* runs the ping command for the IP address, saves the IP for re-use.

>r [computername or IP] ipconfig
* runs the command on the remote PC.

>get [computername or IP] user
* gets the current user that is logged into the remote PC.
